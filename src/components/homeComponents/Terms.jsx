                Restaurant Den may terminate your access to all or any part of
                the Website at any time, with or without cause, with or without
                notice, effective immediately. If you wish to terminate this
                Agreement or your RestaurantDen.com account (if you have one),
                you may contact us to request cancellation of your account.
                Notwithstanding the foregoing, such account can only be
                terminated by Restaurant Den if you materially breach this
                Agreement and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days

                a general shutdown of our service. All provisions of this
                Agreement which by their nature should survive termination shall
                survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership
                provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of
                liability.
